# Embeddable Podcast Player
A simple, customizable podcast player for you to embed on your website.

## FAQ

### What is this?
Put simply, this is an open source version of the embedded player found on [The Human Equation's website](https://rebrand.ly/human-equation). It was designed with podcasts in mind, but it can be used to play any type of audio.

### What makes this player unique?
While other players require you to put in to work to make sure they are embedded in such a way that the content fits within the iframe, this one will automatically expand to fill a frame of any size, allowing you to build the website of your dreams without having to work around an uncooperative embedded embedded player. While some elements may not fit within the box at small sizes, this can be easily fixed by resizing these elements. Over time, we hope to improve the player to automatically adapt to iframes of any size by changing the size of the text and the control elements.

### How do I use the player?
There are a number of modifications that can be made to the player, including the colors of the outer border, the appearance and animation of the text, and the background color of the control area. All of this can be done through the mainstyle.css file. Once you have completed your customizations, you can set up the player using the process described in the Wiki. These are organized by the major update number of the release/version you are using (the number before the decimal point), so make sure you are looking at the instructions for the correct version. If you need additional help, you can file an issue and we'll be happy to lend a hand.

### What does the license mean?
The license is there to allow you to use this code for your own creations while ensure we get credit for our work. We are not lawyers, and nothing we say here represents a binding agreement or legal advice, but we want to inform you that the goal of utilizing the license is that **the source code** of any projects you create using our code will include the following:

- A copy of the license itself and a statement that it applies to the code that is directly based on our project
- A similar license applied to your code unless our code is just a small piece of a much bigger project
- A link to this repository and a statment that some or all of your code was based on this project

To be clear, we are not trying to discourage you from using our code, quite the opposite, in fact. We simply want to ensure that the open nature of the project is maintained across forks and that everyone who wants to implement something similar is able to find this project in order to do so.

### What's the format for release/version numbers?
Each release/version will have a 2 number code to represent the type of changes that were made (ex. v2.3). An increase in the number after the decimal place indicates a minor update, such as a bug fix, asthetic changes, or another update that does not dramatically change the intended functionality of and process to use the player. An increase in the number before the decimal place represents a major update, which will usually be a combination of new features, low-priority bug fixes, and some amount of asthetic changes. Major updates will often change the process of setting up the player, so check out the Wiki before upgrading through a major update. There is no set number of minor updates that any major release will receive, rather we will define a new minor update each time the project reaches stability after an issue is resolved with a code change.
