Hi! We're glad to see that you're considering contributing to this project. From bug reports to helping to develop completely new features, your contributions are the backbone of any open source project, and ours is no different. 

Every contribution to this file follows the same process, and this file is here to walk you through that process so you know what to do and how to do it.

## Issues
Every contribution you make in this reposititory will start with an issue. Despite the name, issues are also a way for you to ask questions, provide feedback, and suggest features, in addition to letting us know about bugs. Once an issue is filed, the community can discuss it, providing additional information about a bug, explaining how a new feature you suggested would also be useful to them, or making any number of meaningful contributions to the conversation. **Whenever possible, you should use a template to create an issue.**

### Open Issues
If an issue requires special attention, we'll demonstrate that with a label. In some cases, a team member will be assigned to fix the bug or add the feature at the same time that the label is applied. In other cases, the label will become an open issue, one that needs someone's attention but doesn't have anyone to help out at the moment. *Some labels, such as won't-fix, indicate that the issue does not need an assignee. This will be obvious either from the name of the label or from the discussion within the issue.* If you find an open issue that you can and want to solve, let us know in the conversation. We'll talk to you about our goals for resolving this issue (such as decribing the intended functionality of a new feature) and, if everything works out, we'll assign the issue to you. Once you have an issue assigned to you, you can move on the the next phase.

## Development
This is your time to shine! Create a fork of the project and get to work resolving the issue (although you are always welcome to ask for help in the original issue if you find you've bit off more than you can chew). We do have a couple rules about what you submit at the end, so you might want to look over our guidelines for pull requests before you get started to avoid having to go back and make additional changes to bring your code into compliance. The one request we have regarding this phase is that you resist the urge to make changes outside of the scope of the issue you are resolving (even if you are assigned to more than one issue, each issue should result in a separate pull request, and should therefore be resolved in a separate fork of the project. If you discover any bugs or have any new suggestions that are not related to the issue you are resolving, you should create a new issue so that we can review your feedback before suggesting changes. We will take steps to minimize change to the code that could invalidate ongoing development, including holding off on changes to the part of the code you're working on.

### Testing
Part of the development process is checking that your change has resolved the issue. Please test your code on as many devices and browsers as is convienent for you to ensure that:
1. The issue has been resolved to the full extent of your testing
2. Your modifications to the code do not cause any functional or aesthetic changes beyond those necessary to resolve the issue
Once you feel your code has met both of these requirements, you can move on to the next step

## Pull Requests
Once you have finished the development process, it's time to add your code to the project. To do so, simply create a pull request with your fork. **Make sure you link to the original issue in your pull request. Pull requests that do not link to an existing issue will be ignored to avoid spam.** Once you have created a pull request, it will go through the following review process before being integrated into the main project.

### Pull Request Review Process
#### Feature Parity
Excluding the changes necessary to resolve the issue linked in your pull request, there should not be any funcitonal or aesthetic differences between the code in the master branch and your pull request. You are responsible for updating your code to reflect any changes that were made to the master branch during your devlopment process before creating a pull request. 

#### Branching
In many cases (especially when you are introducing new features), we will create a new branch and have you merge your file into that branch for additional testing. At this point, it is no longer necessary for you to be actively contributing to the review process, although it is your responsibility to resolve any issues that are discovered during this testing, so you should check for updates to both the original issue any pull requests that link to it regularly. Once your code is determined to be bug-free, we will merge the branch with the master branch and close the issue.

#### Merging
Once your code has met all the requirements and any related bugs have been resolved, we will approve your pull request for merging. Usually, we will merge all pull requests into a new branch that will eventually be merged into the master branch for a new release. Once the original issue is marked as closed, your responsibility to complete all tasks related to that issue has ended, although this does not apply in cases where the issue is accidentally closed (such as when a pull request is merged into a new branch for testing and the bug is automatically closed).
---
As you can see, there are many ways to contribute to this project, regardless of your skill level. If you're just getting started, try creating an issue or resolving one of the issues with the `good first issue` label. If you have any questions regarding these guidelines, create an issue and we'll be happy to clarify.
