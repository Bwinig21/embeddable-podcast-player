# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
At The Human Equation, we have always believed that the unique experiences that everyone brings to the table makes our species especially suited to collaborative work. As such, we expect that everyone participating in this community to treat others with respect, regardless of their personal or physical attributes, coding experience, or any other aspect of their identity, personality, or physical appearance. We pledge to hold ourselves to this standard an ensure a welcoming environment conducive to collaborative work across the community. Belittling, harassing, abusing, and bullying do not contribute to the creative process and have no place in this community.

## Our Standards

We expect all interactions within this community demonstrate positive behaviors, such as:

- Showing respect for other people and their work
- Accepting and providing constructive feedback with the understanding that it is a critique of the work, not the person behind it
- Staying on topic and avoiding topics known to be controversial
- Being supportive of your fellow contributors

Community members will face consequences if they exhibit negative behaviors, such as:

- Attacking others for any reason, including the perceived quality of their work
- Repeatedly pointing out shortcomings of somebody's code without offering advice or support
- Starting arguments or causing conversations to lose focus on the topic at hand
- Using language intended to diminish others' self-esteem
- Engaging in inappropriate interactions, whether solicited or not
- Exploiting perceived loopholes in this Code of Conduct
- Falsifying reports of violations against another community member

## Our Responsibilities

#### Behavior
Like all members of the community, we have a responsibility to comply with this Code of Conduct and treat others in a respectful manner. As maintainers of this project, we have an additional responsibility to demonstrate acceptable behavior.

#### Guidelines
The maintainers of this project are also responsible for setting and clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior within this community. We reserve the right to change this Code of Conduct at any time and interpret these guidelines in a way that we determine to be fair and conducive to collaborative work.

#### Moderation
We also have a responsibility to ensure that this community remains in compliance with this Code of Conduct by reviewing all interactions within this community and responding to all reports of inappropriate behavior in a timely manner. We will have the final say in removing anything that we deem to be a violation of these terms from the community.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all interactions within this community. While we cannot enforce this Code of Conduct when interactions involving our community members occur outside this community, we will investigate and respond to any reports of inappropriate behavior by a community member regardless of where the behavior occurred. If we determine that a community member's behavior outside this community represents a serious violation of this Code of Conduce or demonstrates a likelihood of violating this Code of Conduct in the future, the community member may face consequences in this community.

## Enforcement
If you encounter believe you have encountered a violation of this Code of Conduct, you may inform us by texting or leaving a voicemail at 301-284-0644â€¬. Your message should include:

- The username of the alleged offender
- A brief summary of the actions that you believe violate this Code of Conduct
- An explaination of how we can find evidence of this behavior
- The best way to get in contact with you if we need additional information

All reports of inappropriate behavior will be investigated in a timely manner. After our investigation, we will take any action we deem necessary, potentially including:

- Removing any interactions within this community that are in violation
- Warning the offender that further violations will result in serious consequences
- Placing the offender on a probationary period during which any further violations will result in a permanent ban
- Limiting the offender's ability to participate in this community
- Temporarily or permanently banning the offender from this community
- Sharing certain types of violations (including threatening language) with law enforcement

The identity of the reporter will not be shared at any point, and reporters are encouraged to remain anonymous if they believe there is a possibility of retaliation. Once we have taken action in response to a violation, the potential of and process for requesting a review of the case will be determined on a case-by-case basis. In many instances, our decision is final unless we are made aware of new evidence that would have resulted in a dramatically different initial decision.
